# The GitHub Black Market That Helps Coders Cheat the Popularity Contest

## An interesting article I found

I thought this article was both funny and relevant. Though there has always been a well-known market for buying fake engagement on big social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, I never thought about other sites like GitHub. Probably because one would assume the need for "validation" on these sites from others/engagement
is understandably less. However according to the article, some people have been buying it to make their resumes look better which makes more sense but is still quite funny. Apparently companies also use it attract attention from potential investors as well. Of course, GitHub has been trying to crack down on it.
